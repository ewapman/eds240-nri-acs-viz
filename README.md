# EDS 240: Homework 2
By Emily Wapman

This repository contains data and scripts for Homework 2 and 3 for EDS 240. 
The data is from FEMA National Risk Index (2025 Release) and is used to create a visualization that answers the question: 
How do FEMA National Risk Index scores for counties in California compare to those in other states?

In homework 3, I explored the question: How does climate hazard risk exposure vary across racial/ethnic groups in California?
